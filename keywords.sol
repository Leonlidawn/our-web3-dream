https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33839154/in-ethereum-solidity-what-is-the-purpose-of-the-memory-keyword

unknown length data is stored in heap(memory) which is slower to access, fixed length data
is stored in stack(storage) instead.

Since memory keyword can only be used in methods, 
by default memory is applied to function argument, 
so specifying memory keyword is actually redundant!

fixed length data:
  unit256
  int256
  bool
  bytes
  char

dynamic length data:
  string, which is same as char[]
  arrays

If you declare variables in functions without the memory keyword,
then solidity will try to use the storage structure.

here are defaults for the storage location,
depending on which type of variable it concerns:

- state variables: always in storage
- function arguments: always in memory
- local variables of struct, array or mapping type: reference storage by default
- local variables of value type (i.e. neither array, nor struct nor mapping): stored in the stack

visibility Quanitifiers for variables:
- internal:
 - Internal functions/ Variables can only be used internally or by derived contracts.
 - by default funcitons are internal, which means it can be accessed within the contract by calling fn()

- external: 
  âˆ’ External functions are meant to be called by other contracts. 
  - To call external function within contract this.function_name() call is required. 
  - State variables cannot be marked as external.

- public:
  - Public functions/ Variables can be used both externally and internally. 
  - For public state variable, Solidity automatically creates a getter function.

- private:
  âˆ’ Private functions/ Variables can only be used internally and not even by derived contracts.



Getter functions (those which return values) can be declared either view or pure:
  - view: 
      - Functions which do not change any state values, no gas fee if called externally
      - If called internally from another non-view function, it will still cost gas,
        as that non-view function creates a transaction on Ethereum, and will still need to be verified from every node.
  - pure: 
      - Functions which do not change any state values, but also don't read any state values, 
      - can only call other pure functions
      - if caller function is not free, then this pure function costs gass fee.


modifiers
   - can be run before and/or after a function call. 
   - commonly used for restricting access to certain functions, validating input parameters
   - concept is similar to middlewares or decorators but more flexible

events
  - allow contracts to perform logging on the Ethereum blockchain. 
  - contract event logs can be parsed later to perform updates on the frontend interface.
  - can also be used as a cheap form of storage.
  
constructors
   - optional function that is executed when the contract is first deployed.


to send or receive eth
   - use call.value(p.amount)(p.data) to send
   - need both receive() and fallback() to receive eth.

library
  - similar to contracts in Solidity, but cannot contain any state variables, and cannot transfer ETH.
  - just provides a set of utility funcitons
